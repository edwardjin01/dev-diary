Simple Setences

Compound Sentences

  Made up of at least two independent clauses expressing closely related idea of euqal or similar importance that are joined using a comma and a conjunction or just a semicolon

    Does eaach clause contain a subject and a verb?
    Can each clause stand alone to express a complete thought?
    Are the two clauses closely related and of equal or similar importance?

  Example
    She wanted to play tennis, but he wanted to play basketball

  Forming a compound sentence using a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)

    When we use a coordinating conjunction to form a compound sentence, it is preceded by a comma

  Forming a compound sentence using a correlative conjunction ( either .. or, just as .. so, neither .. nor, not .. but, not only .. but also, wheather .. or)

    When we use correlative conjunctions, a comma precedes the conjunction that introduces the second independent clause.

  Forming a compound sentence with a conjunctive adverb (accordingly, as a result, comparatively, in fact, moreover, nevertheless, nonetheless, on the other hand, otherwise)

  Conjunctive adverb is only used to join independent clauses

  Forming a compound sentence with a semicolon

  Common errors: comma splices and run-on sentences

Complex Sentences

  Made of one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. The dependent clause is introduced and linked to the independent clause by a subordinating conjunction

  We use complex sentences to indicate a specific relationship between two ideas, and to clarify which of the two is more important

  Subordinating Conjunction: after, although, as, as soon as, because, even if, in case, in order that, providing, since, though, when, where

  When the dependent clause is placed first, we generally follow it with a comma. However, if the independent cluase introduces the sentence, we usually do not need a comma

Compound-Complex Sentences

  Made up of two independent clauses (also known as main clauses) and one or more dependent clauses (or subordinate clauses)

    "Because I love to read, i like to visit the libary, and I enjoy going to book stores, too" (coordinating conjunctinon)
    "Because I love to read, not only, do I like to visit the library, but I also enjoy going to book stores, too" (correlative conjunction)
    "Because I love to read, I like to visit the library; additionally, I enjoy going to book stores." (conjunctive adverb)
    "Because I love to read, I like to visit the libary; I enjoy going to book stores, too." (semicolon)
    
  Multiple dependent clauses

  Complex-compound sentences can also have more than one dependent clause.

    "Although I promised I'd study with Ethan, I'd rather go to the movies with Jin; nevertheless, I made a promise even if it isn't as much fun."

Declarative Sentences

  A declarative sentence makes a statement or argument about what is, was or will be the case. That is, it talks about that which is asserted to be true.

  Declarative sentences usally end in a preiod.

  They can also end in an exclamation point

  Declarative sentences can be formed in any tense, so long as the sentence is a statement of what is the case
  
  Not all declarative sentences are straightforward statements of positive fact - there are a few variations that express slightly different information, while still remaining declarative in nature

  Negative declarative sentences are declarative sentences whose information is made negative by the word not or never
    "I won't be going to the party because I have an exam tomorrow."
    "I did not  eat your sandwich." (simple sentence - past tense - made negative by not)
    "Jum is a good guym but you can never rely on him." (compound sentence - present simple tense - second independent clause made negative by never)

  We generally use imperative sentences to issue commands or instructions, and interrogative sentences to ask questions or make requests
    "Clean your room." (imperative sentence)
    "Would you buy me a video game while you're at the mall?" (interrogative sentence)

  Statements of uncertaincy
    "I was thinking we could see the movie togerther, if you're free."
    "They want to know why you did this."

  Indirect question
    "Dan asked if you are coming to the study session this evening."
    "They told me to ask where you're going later."

  Declarative questions
    "You're firing me?"
    "He wants to drive to the city at this hour?"
    "She's moving to Russia?"

Interrogative Sentences

  An interrogative sentence is simply a sentence that asks a question - that is, we use ti when we interrogate someone for information. Interrogative sentences always end with question marks.

  Yes/No questions
  Alternative questions
  "Wh-" questions
  Tag questions
  Other interrogative sentences - Me? So? Well?
  Indirect questions

Negative Interrogative Sentences

  Negative interrogative Sentences (soemtimes called interro-negative sentences) are interrogative sentences that are made negative. In addition to asking literal question, negative interrogative sentences are often used to imply that the speaker is expecting a certain answer or for emphatic effect

Imperative Sentences

  We use imperative sentences to give order, commands, and general instructions

Conditional Setences

  Conditional sentences are in the conditional mood (a sub-category of the subjunctive moood), which is used for hypotetical scenarios that are dependent on a certain condition or conditions. They are useally constructed using if to identify the conditnion that must be met.

  There are four "degrees" of conditionals, all of which vary in structure and meaning.
